# Virt-A-Mate Director

Controls where the "camera" is. Compatible with [Passenger](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-passenger) for moving in and out of POV mode.

## How to use

1. Add the `Director.cs` file to an `Animation Pattern`.
2. Check the `Active` checkbox in the plugin options to move the camera to the animation step each time a new one is activated.
3. Optionally activate using a button, while resetting the animation, and stopping at the end of the animation for a one-time serie.
